\title{vb_ReqDesigns - An internal function that checks the formula call.}

\description{
The function makes a call to 'vb_Designs_check' and checks that the names included in the formula call is the same as those included in the design matrices. It then also constructs 'W' and 'X' as used by the function 'vb_model2_la'.
}

\usage{
vb_ReqDesigns(formula, design_mats)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula }{ - Double right-hand side formula describing covariates of detection and occupancy in that order.}
  \item{design_mats }{ - A named list generated by the call vb_Designs(W, X, y).}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\value{
\item{W }{ - W matrix that is used internally by the function 'vb_model2_la'.}
\item{X }{ - X matrix that is used internally by the function 'vb_model2_la'.}
